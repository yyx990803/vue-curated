# vue-curated

This repository is the primary data source for the curated app. It has a [client](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-curated-client) and a [server](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-curated-server). It is live at [curated.vuejs.org](http://curated.vuejs.org/).

**The goal is to have few high-quality choices so that developers can quickly find the best package for their need. Only a handful of packages will be accepted for each category.**
